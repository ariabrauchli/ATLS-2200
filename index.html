<h2>Aria Brauchli (she/her)</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Aria Brauchli, and I'm a junior majoring in Creative Technology and Design.</p>
<p>I am from Bethesda, Maryland, and enjoy taking photos. I'm excited to learn more about </p>
<p>web design so I can reach my goal of hopefully make my own photography website one day with my refined skills. </p>
